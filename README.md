## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the Stakeholders understand their customers better. It helps the Stakeholders know if their customers are satisfied with their services. 

The dashboard should include key metric such as total sales, total profit, sales by product category, sales by region , sales by customer segment, profit by category and sub category and region wise sales.

It should also provide comparisons of performance according to year as well as can filter through all thr charts by yearly sales and profit happens.
